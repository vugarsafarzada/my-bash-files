# my-bash-files
These are bash files to create project with my env

To give permission to run a bash file on a Mac, you need to make it executable. Use the following command in the Terminal:

```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
```

Replace `filename.sh` with the name of your bash file. After this, you can run the file using:

```bash
./filename.sh
```
